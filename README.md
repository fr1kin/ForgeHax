A Minecraft cheat that runs as a Forge mod

Since ForgeGradle has updated to 2.3, Java 8 Version 131 (lastest as of writing this) is required. Make sure your JAVA_HOME is set to this version of the JDK. If you don't, setupDecompWorkspace will fail at recompileMc.

You should allocate more ram when running `setupDecompWorkspace` (around 4GB should be ok)

I recommend allocating more ram in both environments as the BlockEsp mod requires a lot of space for the vertex buffers. I might get around to fixing this if it becomes too big of an issue.
